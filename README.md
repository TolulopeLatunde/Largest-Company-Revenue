# Largest-Company-Revenue-Python

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating web scraping techniques using Python. The project extracts data of largest companies by revenue from websites, processes the content, and saves it in structured formats like CSV, and JSON for further analysis. The scraping is carried out using libraries such as BeautifulSoup, and requests, making it suitable for both static and dynamic web pages.
